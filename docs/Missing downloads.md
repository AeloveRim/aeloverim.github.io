# Commonly Missing Downloads

The latest versions of wabbajack have trouble downloading mods from Loverslab. If you're getting messages about missing downloads after the installation ends, that's probably why. If so, you should download the following mods into your wabbajack download folder before starting the installer : 

- [BadDogHoodiesV11.8](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/6593-bad-dog-hoodies-sse/)
- ["Amorous Adventures Text and Player Dialogue Revision.zip and OPTIONAL - AA Elisif Start Dialogue Only in Blue Palace.zip"](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/23233-amorous-adventures-text-and-player-dialogue-revision/)
- [CBPC VRSex v1.41.zip](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/29662-cbpc-vrsex/)
