# Commonly Missing Downloads

The latest versions of wabbajack have trouble downloading mods from Loverslab. If you're getting messages about missing downloads after the installation ends, that's probably why. If so, you should download the following mods into your wabbajack download folder before starting the installer : 

Loverslab mods : [https://rentry.co/x8e3vi5w](https://rentry.co/x8e3vi5w)

Make sure you download the versions indicated. If the link contains an "AND", download **both** versions indicated.

And a last reminder : If your download folder is nested inside your modlist installation folder, as wabbajack does by default, it will be erased every time you reinstall and *you will lose all downloaded archives*, including those you may have downloaded manually.
